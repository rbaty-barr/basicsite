# About the files in this folder
1. Icons for favicon and save to desktop, etc
2. Various placeholder images

## Icons
I recomend [favic-o-matic](http://www.favicomatic.com/) for generating the full range of icons needed for our sites. These images can live at the root of this directory. The placeholder images can live in the placeholder directory - just push this folder up to your project and you will be set with defaults for the various scripts that need them. 

## Placeholder images
1. Social Media Share Image Default (1200 x 643)
